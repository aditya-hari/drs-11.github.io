Must work in: <strong>Linux</strong></p><p>Create a program, in C, that utilizes queues and memory-based interprocess communication.</p><p>We&rsquo;re writing a system that encodes video using hardware encoders, specifically nVidia GPUs.
These consumer-grade GPUs are limited to two simultaneous encode sessions. However they can encode (really) fast, easily at 300 frames per seconds.</p><p>We want to overcome this limitation by distributing the load in software.
Suppose you have 10 cameras each of them providing a never ending stream of video at 30 frames per second.
The job is to come up with a good plan (and proof of concept) that maximizes GPU usage.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a few things that will help you:</p><ul><li>You will need to have a queuing system that take the frames. Let&rsquo;s assume on the assumption that there is one process that reads data from one specific camera, so if there&rsquo;s 10 camera there are 10 such processes. They are the producers. Let&rsquo;s call them CameraManagers.</li><li>Because of the way video encoding works (in which one frame can be compressed a lot by using information from the previous one), you can &rsquo;t just merge data from all the cameras and them send to the GPU as they arrive. Instead, you will need to batch them and send a number of frames from one specific camera (maybe 2 seconds, so 60 frames) at a time. We&rsquo;ll call the program that manages the work queue and the GPU the GPU manager.</li><li>Remember that while you do this the frames will continue to arrive.</li><li>Frames are big, so you want to minimize copying data around. For this, you have shared memory between processes.</li><li>A possibility here is to have one GPUManager, that will take the frames from the the CameraManagers. The GPUManager will need to keep one list of pending frames per camera and a queue of cameras. When a camera has sent 60 frames its list of pending frames is ready to be encoded. The GPUManager then encodes those frames (that causes a file to be generated with the output, but that&rsquo;s not needed for this exercise) and clears the list. Remember that while encoding was in progress other frames may have arrived and you don&rsquo;t want to lose them.</li><li>As mentioned, there&rsquo;s 2 encode sessions. The GPUManager needs to support that and simultaneously encode two frame-queues at a time.</li><li>Cameras can be added, removed, and come down (for example, they can break, or their CameraMananger can crash). You system needs to be tolerant to this.</li><li>You need to create the mockup CameraManager and the Mockup GPUManager. Since you don&rsquo;t have cameras of course, for each frame read a block of 1280x800 bytes from /dev/urandom.</li><li>Demostrate that it works will by validating the output, for example using a checksum of each input frame and writing it to the output which can be a sample text file that contains the &ldquo;camera number&rdquo;, &ldquo;frame number&rdquo;, and &ldquo;checksum&rdquo; for that frame, in order.</li></ul><h3 id=meetup-auto-rvsp>Meetup auto-RVSP</h3><p>Language: Any
Must work in: <strong>Linux</strong></p><p>This task is relatively simple (in theory), but it will help us assess your code organization abilities.</p><p>Write a program for meetup.com that sends an auto-RVSP to specific groups. For example, suppose you are a member of 7 different Meetup groups, some of which have very popular events that fill up quickly. You want to sign up for them as fast as possible to ensure that you get a spot.</p><p>Your program needs take care of authentication, searching for events in configured groups (not all), and automatically signing up on the user&rsquo;s behalf in a timely manner. Usage of existing Meetup client libraries is permitted.</p><p>It&rsquo;s OK for your program to be a simple command-line tool that needs to be run from cron once an hour or something like that.</p><h3 id=plan-for-migrating-our-dokuwiki-website-to-fastpages>Plan for migrating our DokuWiki website to fastpages</h3><p>Language: Any
Must work in: Linux (whatever migration system you come up with)</p><p>Our website currently uses an easy-to-use wiki solution called <a href=https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki>DokuWiki</a>, but the aesthetics could be better.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a <a href=https://fastpages.fast.ai/>new platform</a> that uses GitHub Pages for hosting and pull requests for content management. It seems to integrate well with things we care about, e.g. YouTube embeds.</p><p>Can you devise a good plan for migrating from DokuWiki to fastpages?</p><h3 id=export-data-from-myfitnesspal-to-grafana>Export data from MyFitnessPal to Grafana</h3><p>Language: Any
Must work in: Linux (anything server side)</p><p>MyFitnessPal is a mobile app used to track food & energy intake, exercise, and more. It supports CSV data export (e.g. through email) to facilitate archival, but this style is a bit antiquated for manual viewing.</p><p>A simple website that accepts CSV exports and renders nice visual representations using Grafana would be much better for users. This should be feasible to complete in a few days since all of the major components already exist.</p><h3 id=voxelspace-in-flutter>VoxelSpace in Flutter</h3><p>Language: Flutter
Must work in: Android, iOS (OK if you can just test in one, but we will test in both and if it doesn&rsquo;t work we&rsquo;ll send you the debug info so you can fix it).</p><p>A couple decade ago a superfun helicopter game took the gamers by storm. Well, that&rsquo;s a bit hyperbolic but it was really fun and a lot of people spent thousands of hours flying that helicopter.</p><p>What made it revolutionary was the technique used to draw the terrain. Of course that&rsquo;s obsolete by today&rsquo;s standards, but it still looks quite good, considering it&rsquo;s age.</p><p>Your job is to write a simple Flutter program that does the same thing. And no, you don&rsquo;t have to research VoxelSpace by yourself - there&rsquo;s source code already, but not in Flutter.</p><p>Write a Flutter program that does <a href=https://s-macke.github.io/VoxelSpace/VoxelSpace.html>this</a>. And to make it more interesting, edit the terrain map so the text &ldquo;GSoC 2020, CCExtractor Development&rdquo; can be read when flying.</p><h3 id=beacon-in-flutter>Beacon in Flutter</h3><p>Language: Flutter
Must work in: Android, iOS (OK if you can just test in one, but we will test in both and if it doesn&rsquo;t work we&rsquo;ll send you the debug info so you can fix it).</p><p>Write a Flutter app that is able to share your location with anyone who has a specific passkey. For example, suppose you are going to start a hike with friends and you want them to know your location but only for the next 3 hours. You can do that in many ways, but let&rsquo;s say one is by letting people look up a passkey somewhere (to simplify things consider that it&rsquo;s OK to look up a list of passkeys in a static file hosted in github, so you don&rsquo;t need to setup a database).</p><p>Your app then will have two modes of operation: Someone is sharing their location (that means &ldquo;carrying the beacon&rdquo;) and everybody else can see that location (they are &ldquo;following the beacon&rdquo;).</p><h3 id=camera-with-intelligent-autozoom-in-flutter>Camera with intelligent autozoom in Flutter</h3><p>Language: Flutter
Must work in: Android, iOS (OK if you can just test in one, but we will test in both and if it doesn&rsquo;t work we&rsquo;ll send you the debug info so you can fix it).</p><p>Write a Flutter app that lets you take pictures of anything and autozooms to the right size to pick up an object that is in view. For example: Take a collection of dogs, or cats (there are probably pretrained models for this, it&rsquo;s up to you to look them up). If your app is used to take a picture of a dog, then the zoom should be automatically adjusted to take a picture of the dog in foreground, even if the dog is a bit far.</p><p>It must be fast or the dog will move!</p><ul class=pa0><li class=list><a href=/tags/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif"></a></li><li class=list><a href=/tags/var class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">var</a></li><li class=list><a href=/tags/www class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">www</a></li><li class=list><a href=/tags/html class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">html</a></li><li class=list><a href=/tags/dokuwiki class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">dokuwiki</a></li><li class=list><a href=/tags/data class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">data</a></li><li class=list><a href=/tags/pages class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">pages</a></li><li class=list><a href=/tags/playground class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">playground</a></li><li class=list><a href=/tags/takehome class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">takehome</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/playground/playground/>playground</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/playground/start/>start</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/wiki/dokuwiki/>dokuwiki</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/wiki/syntax/>syntax</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/wiki/welcome/>welcome</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://example.org/>&copy; My New Hugo Site 2021</a><div></div></div></footer></body></html>
