Congratulations, your wiki is now up and running. Here are a few more tips to get you started.
Enjoy your work with DokuWiki,\
&amp;ndash; the developers
===== Create your first pages =====
Your wiki needs to have a start page. As long as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, this link will be red: [[:start]].
Go on, follow that link and create the page. If you need help with using the syntax you can always refer to the [[wiki:syntax|syntax page]].</description></item><item><title/><link>http://example.org/posts/aws/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/posts/aws/</guid><description>Amazon AWS deployment This is a guide for deploying, configuring and administrating CC Repository on Amazon Web Service.
